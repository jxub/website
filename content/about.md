# Hi, nice to meet you!

I build software with Python, Go, and JavaScript. Ocassionally I like to give talks or attend hackathons.
Currently I work at [Datamaran](https://www.datamaran.com/) and [Finametrix](finametrix.com/).
To get a grip on the fundamentals of CS, I am also studying it at [UPV](www.upv.es) in Val√®ncia, Spain.

Have a look at my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0-FAxnpMWG1RWN3RW4zdjRDcmc/view?usp=sharing), let's get in touch!
