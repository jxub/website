# Hi, nice to meet you!

I build software with Python, Go, and JavaScript. Ocassionally I like to give talks or attend hackathons.
Currently I work at [Datamaran](https://www.datamaran.com/) and [Finametrix](finametrix.com/).
To get a grip on the fundamentals of CS, I am also studying it at [UPV](www.upv.es) in València, Spain.

Have a look at my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j4P1PYyKIk0OzbpSr6CWRIawK6K1wUUs1sbahL2Qbik/edit?usp=sharing), let's get in touch!
